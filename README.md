# Django Example Website

A Django-based website designed as part of an academic project. It serves as a simple access control panel system for managing RFID tag access and logging access attempts.

## Features

- **User Access Management:** Admin can view a list of registered RFID UIDs and enable/disable them.
- **Access Logs:** Every RFID access attempt is logged with information such as UID, result (granted/denied), and timestamp.
- **Search and Filter:** Admin can search logs and filter by UID or access result.
- **Simple Admin Panel:** Built-in views allow basic data visualization and interaction without needing Django's default admin.
